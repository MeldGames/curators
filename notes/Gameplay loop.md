[[Persistent map generation]]
- Persistent map with unlocking areas
- Map is randomly generated with different shops/digsites you can buy/etc.
- Have a specific quota to fulfill each N days? (maybe just each day? multiple days might give some more interesting possibilities for risk/reward)
- If you dont fulfill the quota, game over
- If you manage to uncover all the digsites then you win

Round based:
- Start round, generates a new digsite
- Have X time before round ends
- Process as many materials/fossils/items as you can before the time runs out
- Round ends and shop replaces digsite
- Buy upgrades/tools/etc.
- Repeat at 1
